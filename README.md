# Stock-Market-Analysis

Analysis of real stock market data using VBA. Add stock market data for any year in a new sheet and run the script to get the results. Appropriate adjustments have been made to the script to allow it to run on every worksheet just by running it once.

The VBA script will loop through all the stocks and calculate/display the following information:
1) Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was.
2) The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed.
3) The total Volume of the stock
4) Conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
5) Locate the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
